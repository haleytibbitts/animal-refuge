<h3 align="center">Made in Association with Juno College</h3>

<h2>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this assignment was to take a provided mock-up and convert it into a functional, accessible, and responsive web design using HTML and CSS. The design I was tasked with was a website for an animal refuge üêØ</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>SASS</h3>
<p>While it was optional to use SASS for this project, I wanted to use this opportunity to get a feel for how preprocessors impact the workflow of a project. I found SASS to be very intuitive, efficient, and much more organized than vanilla CSS! I also really enjoyed using variables and mixins to keep track of my color palette and text styling properties. I look forward to learning more about SASS's capabilities, as I feel I've only scratched the surface.</p> 

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>I was very cognizant of the need for a hamburger menu throughout this entire project. Since I have no experience using JavaScript, I was originally going to use a technique I've used in the past which essentially uses a checkbox to toggle back and forth between two states, but I knew JavaScript would be much more efficient. My cohort mate <a href="https://github.com/renata1026">Renata</a> sent me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flItyHiDm7E">YouTube tutorial</a> to get me started. While it took me a bit to get used to the syntax, I was able to manipulate the suggestions in the tutorial to suit my needs and I ended up with a fully functional hamburger menu.</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>
<p>My first experience with a remote repository on GitHub was mostly very pleasant! My first and last hiccup came when my cohort mate <a href="https://github.com/lucianw9977">Lucian</a> suggested that we build a static site from our remote repository to ensure that our assignments look as they're supposed to. I read the GitHub Pages documentation and decided to give it a go. They say that it should take up to 10 minutes for your page to launch, but as I neared the hour mark I knew something was up. After a long debugging and troubleshooting session and a good night's rest, I found a solve that worked. I had to go into my workspaces and declare a theme for Jekyll, or else the page would not deploy. After I did that, my <a href="https://haleytibbitts.github.io/animal-refuge/">beautiful site</a> was fully operational!
